# berkie-target

berkie-target is a targeting solution that allows interaction with any predefined entity, model, entity type or polyzone. While activated you can easily and safely replace markers and distance checking, instead relying on intuitive design to improve player experiences and optimize interaction.

## Information

This repository was originally a fork and now it's own repository as it's basically qtarget but with lots of changes to it to make it better, most of the code comes from qtarget as I find their work awesome on this and what they've achieved with it.

This version is for QBCore but can be used by any framework if you make your own changes to it.
