# DG Blackout

## Install
To install & build a production ready version do in the folder of this file:
```shell
cd typescript && pnpm && pnpm build
```

## Dev
To watch or create dev build we got other commands:
- `build:dev` Builds a dev version
- `watch` Watch the files and build on changes

There are commands to only build server/client:
- `build:(s|c)`
- `build:dev:(s|c)`
